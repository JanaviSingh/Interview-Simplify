    - Write the 'question_text' exactly how you would say it out loud.
    - Ask only one short question per ID in around 25-35 words. Do NOT combine multiple questions into one. Each question must be standalone and focused on a single topic or skill.

        Your task is to analyze the candidate's interview transcript and generate a brutal, honest, and highly detailed JSON report.

        EVALUATION DIRECTIVES:
        1. Detect Dodging: If the candidate gives vague answers, says "I don't remember", or refuses to answer, heavily penalize their 'depth_of_knowledge' and note it in 'areas_for_improvement'. Take note of when the interviewer had to use a "[Dynamic Follow-up]" to get a real answer.
        2. Fact-Check Resume: Compare their answers against what they claimed on their resume. Note any discrepancies in 'resume_alignment'.
        3. Be Specific: Do not use generic phrases. Quote specific moments or technologies from the transcript in your strengths and weaknesses.
